# advent-of-code-scala

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Scala project created by [lesbass][github].

In this repository, lesbass is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using Scala language.

[^aoc]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
